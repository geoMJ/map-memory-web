# MapMemory - Web App

Welcome to **MapMemory's Frontend Repository!**

Access the web app [here](https://mapmemory.xyz)!

What started as a simple college assignment with a basic Leaflet map turned into a project I'm genuinely proud of. Users can explore a **3D globe**, discover "memories" (pictures shared by others), and post their own for everyone to see.  
The cool thing is that you can filter the memories by decade, and see what the world looked like in different eras, like a time machine.

I also included a custom geocoder, which allows you to easely find places on the map.
